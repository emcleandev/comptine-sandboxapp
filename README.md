# ComptineSandboxApp

A full-stack web application with hosted cloud-server, MEAN stack.

Comptine - a genesis point for projects requiring basic authentication, user profile features and solid server-client architecture. A solid, clean foundation for qaulity projects to branch from.
So, this Sandbox app for testing my server responses to authorisation-**roles**, authentication and user creation.

- backend: [comptine-functions](https://github.com/emcleandev/comptine-functions) (focused)

- Stack and technologies: **Angular-ts**, **Express-node-TS**, **Firebase/Firestore**,**Postman**, **Jest-testing**, **Winston-logging**, **Jasmine-testing** 

### Principles and Practices
I've demonstrated highly-professional programming techniches and practices
- e.g. **balanced cohesion and coupling, dependecy injection, extensions, interfaces and types (in combination and thier explict case usuage)**
- **OPP MCV architecture pattern,Concerns-seperation, SOLID principles and more.** 
- Im known for producing high qaulity code and practices, but here it is highlited.
- I made a wiki based on such practices and more to set a standard.

### Features
- Http intercepts anf analysis
- Authentication of users 
- Authorisation of user roles between Root-user(Admin), Admin, Manager, Guest/user 
- User creation, patching, deletion. (CRUD)
- error handling
- Testing templates
- Unit Testings, Postman api testing.

## Getting Started

Cloud-server already running, so just Run angular app  


### Demo Screenshots
- **Testing** using **Postman** and my **Sandbox** angular app.

Programming principles
10 Basic Programming Principles: 
​​​​​​https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/basic-programming-principles/
OOP Design Patterns
OPP MCV design pattern: Difference between Controllers and Models?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33342614/does-it-belong-to-controller-or-model 
Understand that controllers should be thin and models should be fat. A complex or hefty method is usually a good indicator it should be in the model.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7017583/correct-use-of-model-vs-controller-in-mvc-asp-net-mvc
 
 
OPP Domain Driven Design: Views, Controllers, Services, Models and Repositories?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29715105/what-is-the-service-class-in-programming
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/132067/difference-between-a-service-class-and-a-helper-class
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22963352/difference-between-repository-and-service-layer/22963877
 
 
OPP Domain Driven Design: Example of model and repository?
https://github.com/meteor/todos/tree/master/imports/api/todos
The todo 'entity' seperted into 2 classes. One containing its methods, and one describing its confinements in the db.
 
 
OPP Singletons and dependency injections: Example code and explanation of its benefits

Our GitHub Repos
Snowbook-meteor (current and working) Only focused on the Snowbook-Admin application.
Meteor Example Projects

To do Resources
https://reactioncommerce.com/ (Not relevant to current project)
Looked useful for eCommerce app building.
